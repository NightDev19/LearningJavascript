    What would each of these variables evaluate to?

    1. const one = true && "hi"; // true (right ans : hi)
    2. const two = false && "bye"; // bye (right ans : false)
    3. const three = true || "meow"; // true
    4. const four = false || "rawr"; // rawr
    
    Print them out to the console to see if you got them right.

    HINT : 3 and 4 are more challenging, so don't worry if you don't get them right.
