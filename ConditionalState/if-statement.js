let points = 10;

if(points > 5){ // 10 > 5 -> true : it prints the log inside the statement

}

// Sample 2 

let happy = true;
if(happy === true ){ // true === true : it prints the log inside the statement
    console.log("Yay") // and if the statement is true === false : it didn't print out the log inside the statement
}
console.log("All Done") // it prints out even its either true or false since it is in the outside of the statement
